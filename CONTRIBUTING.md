## How to contribute

__Did you find a mistake, grammatical error, or incorrect information?__
- Please, make sure your finding was not reported before on the [Issues](https://github.com/oAGoulart/awesome-nollm/issues) page.
- If it __WAS__, feel free to add any additional information as a comment.
- If it __WAS NOT__, please do open a new one. Provide a title and clear description, including _what_ is wrong and _how_ to correct it.

__Do you wish to see another software on the list?__
- __DO NOT__ open an Issue. Instead, start an [Idea Discussion](https://github.com/oAGoulart/awesome-nollm/discussions/new?category=ideas).

__Do you wish to merge your own changes into this list?__
- First, open a new Idea Discussion (as above) with details of every change you propose to add.
- PRs without a Discussion to be turned into an Issue will be closed without review.

__Do you have any other questions?__
- Start a [Q&A Discussion](https://github.com/oAGoulart/awesome-nollm/discussions/new?category=q-a) or contact me at 3tr54eh7o (at) mozmail dot com.
