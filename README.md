## Impacts of AI

1. [How crawlers impact the operations of the Wikimedia projects](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/)
    > But with the rise of AI, the dynamic is changing: We are observing a significant increase in request volume, with most of this traffic being driven by scraping bots collecting training data for large language models (LLMs) and other use cases. \[...\] 65% of our most expensive traffic comes from bots.

## Commitment
If you are a developer, show below your commitment to not use nor implement "AI-features" such as LLM chatbots and generative tools. If you are an user, check their repositories for, maybe, more AI-free software.
