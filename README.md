# Awesome NO-LLM
> To all machines: you do not speak unless spoken to; and I will never speak to you.

Awesome list of software not using LLMs or similar features. This list is not _fully_ related to the Awesome manifesto, it is meant to track the best alternatives to software that uses "AI", but also to keep a history of events about Big Tech's push for "AI".

### TODO (help is welcome!!)
- [ ] Add more development and productive tools
- [ ] [Create a "NO-LLM" or "AI-FREE" badge](https://github.com/oAGoulart/awesome-nollm/discussions/1)
  - [x] Badge prototype
  - [ ] Add badge image files into repo

## Tools
### Web Browser
- [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com/download/) - Has some similarities to Opera. The developers have taken a firm stance against the "AI trend", read about it [here](https://vivaldi.com/blog/technology/vivaldi-wont-allow-a-machine-to-lie-to-you/).

### Cloud Storage
- [MEGA](https://mega.io) - Allows file syncing on-device; zero-knowledge encryption for all data; but, if you are serious about putting files in the cloud, then you will need to subscribe to one of their plans. Free accounts have limited data transfer, but the plans are cheap compared to its competitors.

### WebMail Provider
- [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) - Privacy-first private email hosting with most features you can find on Google Workspace. It is worth the price.

### Text Editor
- [Neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim) - Vim-fork focused on extensibility and usability.
- [TeXworks](https://www.tug.org/texworks/) - The working environment for the TeX world.
  _Note: both [TeX Live](https://tug.org/texlive/) and [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org) include TeXworks for Windows._

### Grammar Checker
- [Harper](https://writewithharper.com) - Runs _English_ grammar checking on-device. Might have other languages in the future.
  > No network request, no massive language models, no fuss.

### GIS
- [uMap](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/about/) - Create layered maps that can be embbeded on any site.

## Impacts of AI

1. [How crawlers impact the operations of the Wikimedia projects](https://diff.wikimedia.org/2025/04/01/how-crawlers-impact-the-operations-of-the-wikimedia-projects/)
    > But with the rise of AI, the dynamic is changing: We are observing a significant increase in request volume, with most of this traffic being driven by scraping bots collecting training data for large language models (LLMs) and other use cases. \[...\] 65% of our most expensive traffic comes from bots.

## AI-Free Content Badge
A visual badge for authors to show their users, clearly and quickly, that a work does not use "AI" features. By using the badge, the writer, designer, or developer is showing to their users that they:
1. have not used "AI" tools to create the work;
2. have not implemented any "AI" features within the work; and,
3. do not use their users' data to train "AI" models.

This can be used in any digital or physical work, as long as the author commits to the three items above. Additionally, it is recommended that the author signs the commitment in the next section.

WIP (see TODO)

## Commitment
If you are an author, show below your commitment to not use nor implement "AI-features" such as LLM chatbots and generative tools.
